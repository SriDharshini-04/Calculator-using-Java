This Java program implements a basic calculator that can handle both arithmetic expressions and
 operations on two numbers. Users can choose to calculate a complete expression (like 6+6*5) or
 perform step-by-step calculations with two numbers, using operators such as +, -, *, /, %, and ^. The 
program formats results, handles operator precedence using the basic error handling, such as checking for division by zero.
